## What is BalanceSheetApp?

A balance sheet is a financial statement that provides a snapshot of a company's financial position at a specific point in time. It presents a summary of what a company owns (assets), what it owes (liabilities), and the residual interest in the company's assets after deducting liabilities, known as equity or net worth. Whether you're a small startup or a large corporation, tracking your assets, liabilities, and net worth is essential for financial planning and decision-making. BalanceSheetApp is a simple custom balance sheet that shows a company's assets, liabilities and the owner's equity.
